## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Curation:** Uses Google's Gemini AI to intelligently select songs matching your criteria
- **Detail-Oriented:** Creates playlists based on genres, moods, artists, and other specific parameters
- **User-Friendly:** Simple command-line interface with clear prompts
- **Smart Matching:** Uses fuzzy matching to ensure accurate song identification
- **Human-Like Behavior:** Mimics natural user behavior to avoid API limitations
- **Batch Processing:** Efficiently handles large playlists by processing songs in batches

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER

Avoid excessive use with large playlists in a single day, as it may trigger YouTube's restrictions, potentially preventing you from watching videos or listening to music temporarily. In testing, using it approximately 5‚Äì6 times in a day did not cause any issues.

## üìù Example

Here's an example of creating a workout playlist:

```
Starting AI Playlist Curator...
Initializing YouTube Music client...
YouTube Music client initialized successfully.
Initializing Gemini AI model ('gemini-2.0-flash')...
Gemini AI model initialized successfully.

Fetching your YouTube Music playlists...

Your Playlists:
1. Liked Music
2. All Songs
3. Discover Mix
4. My Mix

Enter the number of the playlist to organize: 2

You selected playlist: 'All Songs'

Fetching songs from playlist 'All Songs'...
Note: Fetching limited song details (Title, Artist, Album if available).
Processing 457 raw song entries...
Successfully processed 457 songs for LLM input.

--- New Playlist Details ---
Enter the title for your new sub-playlist: Workout Energizers
Enter a detailed description for the playlist (e.g., 'Upbeat electronic for coding', 'Melancholic acoustic for a rainy day') (optional, press Enter to skip): High-energy tracks for intense workouts
List desired genre(s), comma-separated (e.g., 'synthwave, retrowave, electronic') (optional): electronic, hip-hop, rock
List preferred artist(s), comma-separated (e.g., 'The Midnight, Carpenter Brut') (optional): Eminem, Foo Fighters
Describe the desired mood(s)/vibe(s), comma-separated (e.g., 'energetic, nostalgic, focused') (optional): energetic, intense, motivational
Any other keywords, comma-separated (e.g., '80s, instrumental, driving beat') (optional): workout, gym, running

Playlist criteria captured.

Asking AI to select songs for the new playlist: 'Workout Energizers' based on detailed criteria...
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

You can customize behavior by editing constants at the top of the script:
- `SONG_ADD_BATCH_SIZE`: Number of songs to add at once (default: 25)
- `MAX_ADD_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts for adding songs (default: 3)
- `FUZZY_MATCH_THRESHOLD`: How strict the song matching should be (default: 65)
- `LLM_TEMPERATURE`: Controls AI creativity level (default: 0.20)

**Advanced Options:**
- Turn on `FETCH_FULL_SONG_DETAILS = True` for even more accurate matching (slower but more precise)
- Adjust `limit` parameters to specify the number of songs or playlists to check

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **API Rate Limits**: If you encounter rate limiting, try waiting a few hours before using the tool again
- **Authentication Issues**: Ensure your headers_auth.json file is up-to-date; YouTube Music occasionally requires re-authentication
- **Song Matching Problems**: Try increasing the `FUZZY_MATCH_THRESHOLD` for stricter matching
