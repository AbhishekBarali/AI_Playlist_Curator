## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Curation:** Uses Google's Gemini AI to intelligently select songs matching your criteria
- **Detail-Oriented:** Creates playlists based on genres, moods, artists, and other specific parameters
- **User-Friendly:** Simple command-line interface with clear prompts
- **Smart Matching:** Uses fuzzy matching to ensure accurate song identification
- **Human-Like Behavior:** Mimics natural user behavior to avoid API limitations
- **Batch Processing:** Efficiently handles large playlists by processing songs in batches

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER

Avoid excessive use with large playlists in a single day, as it may trigger YouTube's restrictions, potentially preventing you from watching videos or listening to music temporarily. In testing, using it approximately 5‚Äì6 times in a day did not cause any issues.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- A Google account with YouTube Music
- Google Gemini API key (easily obtained through Google AI Studio)

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbhishekBarali/AI_Playlist_Curator.git
cd AI_Playlist_Curator
```

Don't have Git? No worries! Just click the green "Code" button at the top of this page and select "Download ZIP", then extract it to a folder on your computer.

2. **Create a virtual environment (Optional but recommended):**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv ytmusicp

# On Windows
ytmusicp\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source ytmusicp/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set up your API keys:**
   - Inside the `.env` file in the project root directory
   - Add your Google Gemini API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

   - If you don't know how to get it:
     1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) (simply login using your Google ID)
     2. Click on "Get API Key" on the top right
     3. Click on "Create API key"
     4. Copy the key

5. **Set up YouTube Music authentication:**
   
   **Run the authentication command:**
   ```bash
   ytmusicapi browser
   ```
   
   **Follow these detailed authentication steps:**
   
   a. **Open a new tab** in your browser
   
   b. **Open the developer tools** (`Ctrl-Shift-I` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd-Option-I` on Mac) and select the **"Network"** tab
   
   c. **Go to** [https://music.youtube.com](https://music.youtube.com) and ensure you are logged in
   
   d. **Find an authenticated POST request:** The simplest way is to filter by `/browse` using the search bar of the developer tools. If you don't see the request, try scrolling down a bit or clicking on the library button in the top bar.
   
   **For Firefox (recommended):**
   - Verify that the request looks like this: Status 200, Method POST, Domain music.youtube.com, File browse?...
   - **Copy the request headers** (right click > copy > copy request headers)
   
   e. **Paste the request headers** when prompted by the ytmusicapi browser command
   
   f. The script will generate authentication data to be saved in `headers_auth.json`

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Run the script:**
```bash
python main.py
```

2. **Follow the interactive prompts:**
   - Select a source playlist from your YouTube Music library
   - Enter criteria for your new playlist:
     - Title (required)
     - Description (optional)
     - Genres (optional)
     - Artists (optional)
     - Moods/vibes (optional)
     - Keywords (optional)

3. **Review and confirm:**
   - The AI will analyze your songs and suggest matches based on your criteria
   - You'll see which songs were matched and have the option to proceed
   - The script will create the new playlist and add the selected songs

4. **Access your new playlist:**
   - Once completed, you'll receive a direct link to your new playlist
   - You can also find it in your YouTube Music library

## üìù Example Usage

Here's an example of creating a workout playlist:

```
Starting AI Playlist Curator...
Initializing YouTube Music client...
YouTube Music client initialized successfully.
Initializing Gemini AI model ('gemini-2.0-flash')...
Gemini AI model initialized successfully.

Fetching your YouTube Music playlists...

Your Playlists:
1. Liked Music
2. All Songs
3. Discover Mix
4. My Mix

Enter the number of the playlist to organize: 2

You selected playlist: 'All Songs'

Fetching songs from playlist 'All Songs'...
Note: Fetching limited song details (Title, Artist, Album if available).
Processing 457 raw song entries...
Successfully processed 457 songs for LLM input.

--- New Playlist Details ---
Enter the title for your new sub-playlist: Workout Energizers
Enter a detailed description for the playlist (e.g., 'Upbeat electronic for coding', 'Melancholic acoustic for a rainy day') (optional, press Enter to skip): High-energy tracks for intense workouts
List desired genre(s), comma-separated (e.g., 'synthwave, retrowave, electronic') (optional): electronic, hip-hop, rock
List preferred artist(s), comma-separated (e.g., 'The Midnight, Carpenter Brut') (optional): Eminem, Foo Fighters
Describe the desired mood(s)/vibe(s), comma-separated (e.g., 'energetic, nostalgic, focused') (optional): energetic, intense, motivational
Any other keywords, comma-separated (e.g., '80s, instrumental, driving beat') (optional): workout, gym, running

Playlist criteria captured.

Asking AI to select songs for the new playlist: 'Workout Energizers' based on detailed criteria...
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

You can customize behavior by editing constants at the top of the script:
- `SONG_ADD_BATCH_SIZE`: Number of songs to add at once (default: 25)
- `MAX_ADD_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts for adding songs (default: 3)
- `FUZZY_MATCH_THRESHOLD`: How strict the song matching should be (default: 65)
- `LLM_TEMPERATURE`: Controls AI creativity level (default: 0.20)

**Advanced Options:**
- Turn on `FETCH_FULL_SONG_DETAILS = True` for even more accurate matching (slower but more precise)
- Adjust `limit` parameters to specify the number of songs or playlists to check

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- **API Rate Limits**: If you encounter rate limiting, try waiting a few hours before using the tool again
- **Authentication Issues**: 
  - Ensure your `headers_auth.json` file is up-to-date
  - YouTube Music occasionally requires re-authentication
  - Try deleting `headers_auth.json` and running `ytmusicapi browser` again
- **Song Matching Problems**: Try increasing the `FUZZY_MATCH_THRESHOLD` for stricter matching
- **Import Errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Rate Limiting Tips:**
- Use smaller playlists when testing
- Don't run the script multiple times in quick succession
- If blocked, wait 24 hours before trying again
